# Machine Learning-Driven EEG Insights (Under Review)

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to analyze EEG (electroencephalogram) data for diagnosing neurological disorders. It provides an end-to-end system that includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using FastAPI.

## Features

- **AI-Powered EEG Analysis**: Implements machine learning models to extract insights from EEG data.

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Covers data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

- **Google Colab Support**: Facilitates model training and experimentation in a cloud-based environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Google Colab**: Used for model development and training.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load EEG datasets and apply feature extraction techniques.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on preprocessed data.
3. **API Deployment**: Use FastAPI to serve predictions.
